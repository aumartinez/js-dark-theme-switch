Let's say you are using in your site a branding palette like the below:

and you want to add to your site a "dark theme" switch as a visual aid to users visiting your website.

Then you can achieve this by using JavaScript.

## First create your switch

Start adding the code and styling for your switch button. Above the first heading title would be the best place for it.

```html
<div class="theme-switch">
  <div class="slider round" data-toggle="active"></div>
</div>
```

Then add the proper styling with CSS.
